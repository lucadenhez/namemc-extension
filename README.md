A Chrome extension to show account creation dates on NameMc!

# Use

In order to use the plugin, either download the source code, (_unpacked_) or download the release. (_compiled_)

Go to the URL in your Chromium browser: 'chrome://extensions', and toggle **on developer mode.** After that's done, either click load unpacked for the source code, and select your un-zipped file, or just simply drag the file into the window if you're using the compiled versions. Cheers!
