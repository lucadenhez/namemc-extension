# namemc-extension
A Chrome extension to show account creation dates on NameMc!

# Use

In order to use the plugin, either download the source code, (_unpacked_) or download the release. (_compiled_)

Go to the URL in your Chromium browser: 'chrome://extensions', and toggle **on developer mode.** After that's done, either click **load unpacked for the source code**, and select your un-zipped file, _or_ just simply drag the file into the window **if you're using the compiled version.** Cheers!

# Privacy

This extension can **only access the namemc.com domain**. All other domains will be ignored as seen in the manifest.json. This software is not privacy invading.

# Publicity

I'm planning to try and release this on the Chrome store, but first I need to ask CoderTim to see if this project is okay.

**CoderTim**, if you're seeing this and do not approve of it, please contact me at my _Discord:_ **lucaa#4787**.

# Credits

Cheers to **CoderTim** for building the awesome Minecraft website, **NameMc.** And a special thanks to the creator of the API, **https://api.ashcon.app/mojang/v2/user/**, for easy access to account creation dates, and _no CORs!_
